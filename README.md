# tsuserverCC

A Python-based server for Attorney Online, forked from [AttorneyOnline/tsuserver3](https://github.com/AttorneyOnline/tsuserver3)

Requires Python 3.7+ and PyYAML.

### Changes/additions from tsuserver3
* Testimony recording/playback system,
* Greatly extended support for custom content,
* More options for area management, including:
  - Accessible hub system, hubs with subareas without need for seperate area lists.
  - Storing/loading hubs up to a 100 areas, complete with connections and music lists,
  - On-the-fly area renaming, creation, and destruction,
  - Password locks,
  - Ability to connect areas via 'exits,'
  - and playercount hiding.
* Serverside notepads,
* Additional moderation features,
* Add music on the fly, and have it appear on the server's music list, (per area/hub basis)
* A category-based music shuffle system,
* Fully-functional(?) party system with Main Game features inbuilt.

## How to use

* Install the latest version of Python. **Python 2 will not work**, as tsuserver3 depends on async/await, which can only be found on Python 3.5 and newer.
  - If your system supports it, it is recommended that you use a separate virtual environment, such as [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for Windows, or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for everyone else (it runs itself using Python).
* Open Command Prompt or your terminal, and change to the directory where you downloaded tsuserver3 to. You can do this in two ways:
  - Go up one folder above the tsuserver3 folder, Shift + right click the tsuserver3 folder, and click `Open command window here`. This is the easiest method.
  - Copy the path of the tsuserver3 folder, open the terminal, and type in `cd "[paste here]"`, excluding the brackes, but including the quotation marks if the path contains spaces.
* To install PyYAML and dependencies, type in the following:
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
  ```
  If you are using Windows and have both Python 2 and 3 installed, you may do the following:
  ```batch
  py -3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
  ```
  This operation should not require administrator privileges, unless you decide to remove the `--user` option.
* Rename `config_sample` to `config` and edit the values to your liking. Be sure to check your YAML file for syntax errors. *Use spaces only; do not use tabs.*
* Run by either double-clicking `start_server.py` or typing in `python start_server.py`, or `py -3 start_server.py` if you use both Python 2 and 3. It is normal to not see any output once you start the server.
  - To stop the server, press Ctrl+C multiple times.

* While recording, you can add new statements by putting in IC `+[Your Statement]`. These will show up as if you're just normally testifying for the first time. 
    - If you're paired and want your partner to have a statement, have the pair add the statement instead. (Make sure they are also a CM.)
* Once you're done recording your testimony, just do `/end`. After this, you can do `///` in IC to make the title appear again, this time with a CE woosh.
* After all that, anyone in the area can say `>` in IC to move to the next statement or `<` for the previous statement, `=` is also available to use to see the current statement again. 
* All the statements will be automatically displayed in green.
* The CM can at this point also add 'substatements' by using +again, and then can also amend the current statement by using &[amended statement] in OOC.
* If you want to clear the testimony, use /cleartestimony in OOC. For viewing the current testimony, simply do /testimony in OOC.
